# GitHub Presentation Resources 🥳
<br>
🍍 Welcome to the Visual Communications team repo! We are here to be your presentation support!🍍
<br> 
<br>
Currently, we are in the process of growing our team so we can expand the resources and services we provide. In the meantime, we have created templates to help you design and develop presentations that are both on-brand and easy to use! Using these templates (available in both light and dark mode 🎉), you can focus on the points you are trying to communicate and craft your content knowing the design aspects of your presentation are easily accessible and already built-in. 
<br>
<br>
You can expect almost all of the same features between the Google Slides and PowerPoint versions except one distinct difference: PowerPoint is designed with our GitHub Brand fonts, Alliance No.1 and SF Mono. This allows you the opportunity to build a presentation deck that is sure to feel like GitHub!

## PowerPoint Templates 
💻 The PowerPoint light and dark mode presentation templates are available on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VWvx1oprxuXhyat1b3quiHxyv-g1G2SN) (You can also find them on [Primer](https://primer.style/presentations/presentation-formats/powerpoint) and [Guru](https://app.getguru.com/card/ik88kdLT/Accessing-and-using-slide-GitHub-Presentation-Template)) 
<br><br>
⚠️ Please note: when presenting, be sure you are using the desktop version of PowerPoint 🚫 NOT the browser 🚫, our brand fronts do not display properly on any browser.
<br><br>
✨ If you haven't already, download and install each of our GitHub brand fonts from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TmYHs5tFFelXqDXlNQ9u1UV_0RSTkyE5). See below for instructions.
